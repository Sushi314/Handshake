      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>"Break a norm." These three simple words from my sociology professor inspired me to challenge a common social practice, leading to surprising discoveries. The norm I chose to break was the handshake. This paper will first describe my experience breaking this norm and the unexpectedly positive responses I received. This encouragement motivated me to collect survey data and conduct interviews, seeking to answer the question: Are handshakes still a cultural norm? The survey focused on public perceptions of handshakes and whether people believe the norm should change. The data suggest that while the majority of respondents like handshakes, they do not necessarily prefer them in either casual or formal settings. In fact, 83% of respondents reported using handshakes almost never or fewer than five times per week. Notably, 74% of respondents aged over 45 stated that the norm is not outdated, compared to 42.9% of those under 24 (See Table 1.5), suggesting that this norm is evolving. Additionally, one respondent agreed to an interview about NoHello, a movement aimed at streamlining digital communication by eliminating traditional greetings (e.g., “Hello, how are you?”) in favor of more direct, actionable messages (e.g., “Hey, [the question]”). This highlights how younger generations tend to view traditional greetings negatively in digital spaces, making it a subject worth further study. Lastly, a surprising finding was that hugs ranked as a close second among preferred greetings in casual settings, suggesting that we might benefit from offering hugs more often. </p>

    <!-- Experiment / Narrative Section -->
    <section id="experiment">
      <h2>Disrupting Social Norms: Handshakes</h2>
      <p>While the pain of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt worldwide, there was one unexpected relief, the handshake was no longer an obligation. In the United States, the handshake is not only a common greeting but also a symbol of business, making it an expectation in professional settings. The handshake has even inspired books (Al-Shamahi, 2021) with many people believing they can determine a person’s personality through it. However, studies show mixed results, suggesting that other social factors are far more influential, making the handshake as a personality indicator largely insignificant (Ships & Freeman, 2003; Chaplin et al., 2000). Armed with this knowledge, my personal dislike for handshakes, and the lingering impact of COVID-19, I set out to challenge this cultural norm.  </p>
      <p>In February 2025, I attended a networking luncheon Northampton Community College. During the event, a panel of speakers provided students with advice on networking and building connections, emphasizing the importance of a firm handshake. After their presentation, we were divided into groups to practice networking with the presenters. When I approached my assigned presenter and they extended their hand for a handshake, I defied expectations and broke the norm. With enthusiasm, I raised my hand, palm forward, and offered a high-five, cheerfully saying, “Yay, team four!” Their expression shifted from awkwardness to a smile, instantly building rapport as we began to chat. Additionally, this unexpected gesture helped me stand out from the crowd an essential aspect of networking. However, the impact was short-lived. The presenters were there to practice networking, not to form genuine connections. While the high-five and enthusiasm initially created a positive and engaging atmosphere, it also disrupted the structured flow of the exercise, throwing the presenter off their script. Their attempts to steer the conversation back to traditional networking practices created tension, making the interaction feel forced and inauthentic. </p>
      <p>Despite my initial success with the high-five, it was clear that breaking a norm, can have unintended consequences. My experiment highlighted the deeply ingrained nature of handshakes in professional settings and how deviations from the norm can disrupt social interactions. This experience led me to wonder: How do others feel about handshakes? Do people value them, or do they simply comply out of habit or expectation? To answer these questions, I decided to do a survey and interviews to gain insight into public perceptions of handshakes. </p>

    <!-- Method Section -->
    <section id="method">
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <h3>Participants</h3>
      <p>A total of 78 people participated in the survey, including 44 women, 25 men, and 7 transgender or non-binary individuals. Participants ranged in age, with 53 individuals under 44 years old and 24 over the age of 44 (Median age: 39 years old). All but four participants accessed the survey by scanning a QR code and completing it online, the remaining 4 filled out a paper copy of the survey. </p>
      <h3>Participant Acquisition</h3>
      <p>Participants were recruited using four different methods:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Flea Market Flyers:</strong>Flyers advertising the survey were distributed at vendor booths at a rural flea market. One vendor displayed multiple flyers and actively encouraged participation. However, they reported that many older participants lacked the technological capability to complete the survey online, which limited the number of responses from older individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Discord Links:</strong> Survey links were shared in multiple public Discord servers (an online communication platform) along with a message stating that the survey was for a college project.</li>
        <li><strong>Doctor’s Office Flyers & Paper Surveys:</strong> Flyers advertising the survey were posted in the staff breakroom of a doctor’s office located in an inner-city area with a diverse population. To accommodate participants who preferred a physical format, paper surveys were also provided. Four paper surveys were completed, all by participants over the age of 55. Additionally, a nurse at the office encouraged people to participate.</li>
        <li><strong>Elementary School Staff Participation:</strong> An employee at an inner-city elementary school distributed the survey to coworkers, requesting their participation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Survey Design</h3>
      <p>The survey consisted of 12 questions with multiple-choice, checkbox, and open-ended responses. Many questions were "yes" or "no" with an optional write-in response for further explanation. However, Question 1, “Do you like handshakes?”, was the only question that offered a simple yes or no response without additional input. The survey was intentionally designed to be straightforward, aiming to assess whether people favor handshakes or if there is a shifting sentiment regarding this cultural norm. This simplicity is also a limitation, as it may not fully capture the nuances of participants' attitudes. Additionally, it is important to note that the survey was neither reviewed by experts nor trial-tested before distribution, which may affect the reliability and depth of the findings. </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Results Section -->
    <section id="results">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Survey data was analyzed using a spreadsheet to calculate values across various criteria. Gender had the most significant impact on views of handshakes, with 80% of men and 63% of women reporting that they like handshakes. However, this does not necessarily indicate that they use or prefer handshakes, as other greeting preferences must be considered. Only 10.25% of participants both like, prefer, and do not feel pressured to shake hands. When broken down by gender, only 2.56% of women and 3.85% of men fell into this category. However, when analyzing preferences by only one setting, there is a notable shift, to 29.48% of participants favoring handshakes in formal settings, while only 7.69% prefer them in casual settings (See Table 1.1) </p>

    <p>Alternatively, when analyzing preferred greetings in formal and casual settings, only men in formal settings showed a strong preference for handshakes, with 72% favoring them. In contrast, among women in formal settings, only 25% preferred handshakes, while 38.6% favored a verbal-only greeting (See Table 1.2). In casual settings, preference for handshakes decreased dramatically across all genders (See Table 1.3). This suggests that setting plays a key role in greeting preferences, a trend further supported by write-in responses such as: “Depends on the situation,” “Depends on the person,” and “Depends on closeness to the person.” Interestingly, the data also reveal that 26% of men who prefer handshakes feel pressured to shake hands in formal settings, with that number increasing to 43% in casual settings. This raises an important question: Why do people prefer handshakes if they feel, or somewhat feel, pressured to engage in them; a subject for future study. </p>

      <p>Next, the data was evaluated to determine whether public perception of handshakes is changing. The first factor assessed was the impact of COVID-19 on people's perceptions, which revealed a 50-50 split with no correlation to age (See Table 1.4). Additionally, the effect was consistent across age groups, indicating that assessing changes in handshake norms over time will not be influenced by the impact of COVID-19. This analysis of survey responses suggests a correlation between age and perceptions of the handshake norm’s relevance. Notably, 70% of respondents aged 45–54 stated that the norm is not outdated, compared to 42.9% of those under 24 (See Table 1.5). Additional data collection would be necessary to conduct a statistical analysis and determine whether this association is statistically significant. </p>

      <p>Finally, an unexpected result emerged regarding the preference for hugs in casual settings, as shown in Table 1.3. Both verbal greetings and hugs were the were popular choices, with 32.1% and 30.8%, of total responses. However, when broken down by gender, a clear difference appeared, 40.9% of women preferred hugs as their primary greeting method, whereas only 16% of men shared this preference. </p>

    <section id="limitations">
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>This survey had several limitations that may have influenced the findings. First, the data was collected over a brief period and had limited reach to the general public. While hosting the survey online increased accessibility for many, it also restricted participation, particularly among individuals who are skeptical of online surveys or older adults who may be less inclined to engage with digital platforms. Additionally, the survey was not tested or peer-reviewed, which may impact the reliability of the results. Finally, the author's personal bias against handshakes may have influenced the study's perspective, potentially shaping the way questions were framed and interpreted. </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Interviews Section -->
    <section id="interviews">
      <h2>Interviews</h2>
      <p>Two informal interviews were conducted individually with a man and a woman, both in their early 30s. </p>
      <p>The first interview, with the man, took place on a digital communication platform and centered around a social interaction that led to conflict. The issue arose when another user sent only a brief greeting, "Hi dwango", without additional context (TerminalChillness, 2025). During the conversation, the user Local Cryptid expressed frustration, stating that receiving "no actionable information" (2025) causes them stress and anxiety. As the discussion progressed, it revealed the NoHello movement, a practice aimed at improving efficiency in digital communication by integrating greetings into the message (The No hello club, 2025). This exchange provides insight into how younger generations perceive greetings, particularly in online interactions. </p>
      <p>The second interview, with the woman, focused on her greeting preferences, particularly how they are influenced by her cultural background. She noted that her family is from South America, where hugs and cheek kisses are the predominant forms of greeting. This highlights how cultural background significantly shapes greeting norms, reinforcing the idea that preferences vary across different social and geographical contexts. </p>

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>When examining cultural norms of greetings, there are unspoken expectations that shape social interactions. While deviating from these norms can sometimes have a positive impact, not everyone is receptive to change, and such deviations can lead to undesired outcomes.  </p>
      <p>Additionally, when analyzing greeting preferences between men and women, a clear gender difference emerges. Research in cross-cultural psychology shows that nonverbal communication in Scandinavian countries tends to be less differentiated by gender, in line with their overall societal commitment to equality (Matsumoto & Juang, 2016). Showing how cultural effects have a greater influence on greeting preferences over innate desires. </p>
      <p>Although the survey indicated that sentiment toward handshakes is changing, it did not reveal a clear trend, and the sample size was insufficient for statistical analysis. However, COVID-19 had a significant impact, with 50% of respondents reporting that their perceptions of handshakes were influenced by the pandemic. The negative impact of COVID-19 on handshake norms is further supported by other polls (Gurchiek, 2023; Perret, 2020; Bruce, 2020). Additionally, Ballard’s (2020) poll found that 31% of Americans stated they would never shake hands again, reinforcing the broader societal shift away from this traditional greeting. One particular response illustrates how the norm is evolving, the respondent reported liking handshakes but almost never using them and not preferring them yet still expressed a desire for handshakes to be brought back. This highlights a key paradox: no matter how much someone wants a norm to persist, if people are not actively adhering to it, the norm will inevitably change. And this can be seen as 83% of respondents almost never use handshakes or use them less then 5 times per week. </p>
      <p>Additionally, with the exception of men in formal settings, other greeting preferences outweighed handshakes by a significant margin. While physical and non-physical greetings are starkly different, hugs and verbal greetings emerged as the top two choices, with only a 1.3% difference between them. However, when analyzing the data by gender, a notable difference appeared. Women preferred hugs by 2.3% more, whereas men showed the inverse trend, favoring verbal greetings by 8%. This close balance may be influenced by the effects of physical touch, which research suggests can lead to decreased blood pressure, increased oxytocin levels, improved attentiveness, and reduced depression. Conversely, a lack of touch may have the opposite effects (Field, 2010; Romney, 2023), leading to an innate need physical touch, handshake or otherwise. </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This study reveals that while handshakes have long been a hallmark of both professional and casual interactions, their role as a cultural norm is increasingly being questioned. The initial experiment, breaking the handshake norm with a high-five, combined with survey data and interviews, demonstrates that although many individuals appreciate the gesture, its actual usage is declining. Notably, a massive portion of respondents reported infrequent handshake use, and age differences indicate that younger generations are more inclined toward alternative greetings, such as hugs or verbal exchanges. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a reevaluation of traditional greeting practices, underscoring a broader societal shift toward more adaptable forms of communication. Despite the limitations of a brief data collection period and potential sampling biases, the findings suggest that social norms are not static; they evolve in response to changing cultural, technological, and health-related influences. Lastly, people should give a hug more often! </p>
